### Project Goals

Everything in & on the portfoliio is there to make the owner more interesting and make the reader more curious. 
Relevent information concerning who the owner is, what they can offer, how well they can offer that service, availablity and location. 
This will feed the requirements of the reader while the overall look, intuitiveness and functionality of the actual site will 
showcase the owner’s personality from a professional standpoint. This will all go to completing the main goals of the site which are:

-	Create interest in owner as developer to increase job opportunities
-	Provide an easy access all in one space for professionally interested parties to find out more about the owner.
-	Showcase lastest and greatest work/projects.

### Target Audience

-	An agency recruiter
-	A specific company recruiter/Headhunter
-	A recently met/networked industry peer
-	A potential freelance client
-	Friends & family looking to offer out my services.

### User Stories

##### Owner: 
- Present self as a skilled & reliable developer to get work.
- Offer easy access to previous work to showcase skills.
- Offer a compelling red thread to the contact section to get the most value from the site.
- Show personality as a developer to give readers a better understanding of meself from a professional standpoint.
- Site should be able to be viewed on any device to maximise interest from all potential perspectives.

##### User: 
- To find out if owner has required skillset for vacancy so they can be offered job.
- To find out if owner would fit in office atmosphere & workflow so they can be offered job.
- To see if portfolio is being updated which would indicate continuous learning and curiousity.
- To see if owner would have interesting enough projects so that they could be recommended for a job.
- To see if owner has made sites like the one I want so I can ask them to make something similar.
- To see if owners work is worth the money that they are charging so I can ask for discounts.
- To easily showcase owners skills in making websites and apps so they can be seen as a good and trusted developer in more circles.

### User Story Analysis

From defining the user stories, goals and objectives of the site were settled. By breaking down each story, we are able to see how each user wants to 
complete an action to get some sort of outcome or value of benefit to them. By separating these outcomes/benefits, we can see that the goals of the 
websites begin to relate to the user/owner outcomes/benefits. Factoring in what we percieved to be user & owner wants & needs, decisions were made on 
what would provide the most value & worth. This in turn then fed the site & feature specific requirements that were developed. These include:

- Easy access to a projects section.
- Easy access to contact information.
- An about me that included both formal/professional and informal personality traits.
- Need for the site to be regularly updated with new interesting projects.
- Simplicity & a cohesive experience.
- A footprint of the owners personality should be left in the overall look of the site.

### Design Choices

Armed with this information, further extensive research was done to best understand what and how the best online portfolio’s look like and function.
Focusing on font choice, color usage, use of shapes and lines & general feel (links to this research found in acknowledgements). 

##### Font

With font choice, it was important that the chosen typeface was contemporary, easy to read & familiar but still different. 
Looking at sites from the brands all over the world over the last few years, there has been a shift to more soft modern fonts and I wanted to take advantage
of this shift to hopefully make the reader have some familiarity with the font type of the brands and sites they visit often and mine. I also wanted the 
font to be easy on the eye, to be easy to read for as many people as possible and be simple enough but with a small unique edge to it.
The chosen font was “Signika” which was found on Google Fonts. The font is a typical signage typeface and actually inspired by fonts such as 
Ronnia, Meta, and Tahoma. The benefit being that it is easy to read with gentle curvatures and perfect for providing clarity of information. 
I also made the choice to only use one font throughout the website to continue building this feeling of familiarity with the user. 
The back up font is Sans Serif.


##### Color

Colors were chosen based on personal preference, improving accessibility & providing purpose. My own personal preference are earthy and muted/pastel colors. 
In the final palette I also wanted to include colors that had enough contrast between them to make sure readability would not be an issue. There also needed 
to be colors to give purpose to elements e.g. green for links, blue to highlight or provide contrast.

The final color palette chosen was:

The black and white colors are both not pure black and white, they were chosen this was to take away from the harshness of the pure black and 
white colors and also to add more elements of softness in tune with the general palette scheme. The blue and green were chosen for purpose and 
preference with both of them being soft and mellow continuing the general theme of the palette. All the colors together provide enough flexibility and 
contrast between them to allow for ideal readability. The soft and mellow characteristics of all the colors also offer a calming space for the information 
to live in, not adding to any potential cognitive overload. The font and color come together to guide the reader through the website smoothly, simply and 
with as little stress as possible.

##### Shapes & Lines

The use of curved corners is a common theme throughout the website & the thought behind this was to reduce overall sharpness and add to the soft theme of 
the site in general. There was a thought to use lines in the background of the site to fill what could be seen as too much empty white space but this was a 
feature deemed not necesarry (will be discussed more in the features section).

##### General feel

As you may have gathered from earlier reading, the design, look and feel of the site was guided by thoughts of softness, ease, mellowness, muted colors 
and clarity. The design choices reflect these concepts and aim to show them all in the best light. Specifics will again be covered more in the 
features section. 

##### Design Wrap Up

Armed with relevent research of what a good portfolio should look like, the site specific requirements and a clear a design concept, the wireframes were 
then drawn out to provide a baseline for the look and structure of the site. I used Balsamiq at this stage to assist in the creation of the wireframes 
for each section of the site. Below I include wireframe images and descriptions to go with them.
