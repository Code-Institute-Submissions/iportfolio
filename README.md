### Project Goals

Everything in & on the portfoliio is there to make the owner more interesting and make the reader more curious. 
Relevent information concerning who the owner is, what they can offer, how well they can offer that service, availablity and location. 
This will feed the requirements of the reader while the overall look, intuitiveness and functionality of the actual site will 
showcase the owner’s personality from a professional standpoint. This will all go to completing the main goals of the site which are:

-	Create interest in owner as developer to increase job opportunities
-	Provide an easy access all in one space for professionally interested parties to find out more about the owner.
-	Showcase lastest and greatest work/projects.

### Target Audience

-	An agency recruiter
-	A specific company recruiter/Headhunter
-	A recently met/networked industry peer
-	A potential freelance client
-	Friends & family looking to offer out my services.

### User Stories

#### Owner: 
- Present self as a skilled & reliable developer to get work.
- Offer easy access to previous work to showcase skills.
- Offer a compelling red thread to the contact section to get the most value from the site.
- Show personality as a developer to give readers a better understanding of meself from a professional standpoint.
- Site should be able to be viewed on any device to maximise interest from all potential perspectives.

#### User: 
- To find out if owner has required skillset for vacancy so they can be offered job.
- To find out if owner would fit in office atmosphere & workflow so they can be offered job.
- To see if portfolio is being updated which would indicate continuous learning and curiousity.
- To see if owner would have interesting enough projects so that they could be recommended for a job.
- To see if owner has made sites like the one I want so I can ask them to make something similar.
- To see if owners work is worth the money that they are charging so I can ask for discounts.
- To easily showcase owners skills in making websites and apps so they can be seen as a good and trusted developer in more circles.

### User Story Analysis

From defining the user stories, goals and objectives of the site were settled. By breaking down each story, we are able to see how each user wants to 
complete an action to get some sort of outcome or value of benefit to them. By separating these outcomes/benefits, we can see that the goals of the 
websites begin to relate to the user/owner outcomes/benefits. Factoring in what we percieved to be user & owner wants & needs, decisions were made on 
what would provide the most value & worth. This in turn then fed the site & feature specific requirements that were developed. These include:

- Easy access to a projects section.
- Easy access to contact information.
- An about me that included both formal/professional and informal personality traits.
- Need for the site to be regularly updated with new interesting projects.
- Simplicity & a cohesive experience.
- A footprint of the owners personality should be left in the overall look of the site.

### Design Choices

Armed with this information, further extensive research was done to best understand what and how the best online portfolio’s look like and function.
Focusing on font choice, color usage, use of shapes and lines & general feel (links to this research found in acknowledgements). 

#### Font

With font choice, it was important that the chosen typeface was contemporary, easy to read & familiar but still different. 
Looking at sites from the brands all over the world over the last few years, there has been a shift to more soft modern fonts and I wanted to take advantage
of this shift to hopefully make the reader have some familiarity with the font type of the brands and sites they visit often and mine. I also wanted the 
font to be easy on the eye, to be easy to read for as many people as possible and be simple enough but with a small unique edge to it.
The chosen font was “Signika” which was found on Google Fonts. The font is a typical signage typeface and actually inspired by fonts such as 
Ronnia, Meta, and Tahoma. The benefit being that it is easy to read with gentle curvatures and perfect for providing clarity of information. 
I also made the choice to only use one font throughout the website to continue building this feeling of familiarity with the user. 
The back up font is Sans Serif.


#### Color

Colors were chosen based on personal preference, improving accessibility & providing purpose. My own personal preference are earthy and muted/pastel colors. 
In the final palette I also wanted to include colors that had enough contrast between them to make sure readability would not be an issue. There also needed 
to be colors to give purpose to elements e.g. green for links, blue to highlight or provide contrast.

The final color palette chosen was:

![image of color palette]
(assets/images/readme/palette.png)

The black and white colors are both not pure black and white, they were chosen this was to take away from the harshness of the pure black and 
white colors and also to add more elements of softness in tune with the general palette scheme. The blue and green were chosen for purpose and 
preference with both of them being soft and mellow continuing the general theme of the palette. All the colors together provide enough flexibility and 
contrast between them to allow for ideal readability. The soft and mellow characteristics of all the colors also offer a calming space for the information 
to live in, not adding to any potential cognitive overload. The font and color come together to guide the reader through the website smoothly, simply and 
with as little stress as possible.

#### Shapes & Lines

The use of curved corners is a common theme throughout the website & the thought behind this was to reduce overall sharpness and add to the soft theme of 
the site in general. There was a thought to use lines in the background of the site to fill what could be seen as too much empty white space but this was a 
feature deemed not necesarry (will be discussed more in the features section).

#### General feel

As you may have gathered from earlier reading, the design, look and feel of the site was guided by thoughts of softness, ease, mellowness, muted colors 
and clarity. The design choices reflect these concepts and aim to show them all in the best light. Specifics will again be covered more in the 
features section. 

#### Design Wrap Up

Armed with relevent research of what a good portfolio should look like, the site specific requirements and a clear a design concept, the wireframes were 
then drawn out to provide a baseline for the look and structure of the site. 

### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq at this stage to assist in the creation of the wireframes 
for each section of the site. After creating the initial structure with Balsamiq, 
I then used Adobe XD to add color and other styling to create an identical version of the site to code from.  
Below I include wireframe images from both Balsamiq and XD and feature descriptions to go with them.


#### Mobile View Home Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe home section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/wire-home.jpg)

A - An early decision was made to have a clear hero section as the starting point of the site. The purpose of this section was to draw attention to the focus of the site, with the text stating who I am and what I do, immediately providing the reader with relative information. I also decided that I wanted this hero element to be neighboured by smaller relevent elements such as some sort of availability and a link to further information.

B – The title/logo element I thought should be clean and simple. The purpose is to confirm what the reader assumes to be my own portfolio so seeing my name in a place where most sites would put a brand adds to the familiarity of the site. It also will provide a link back to this home/hero section.

C – The site needed to be responsive in all viewports so for smaller screens there will be a vertical off-canvas nav menu which will hide away when not needed and slide out from the left when this button is pressed. The button also turns into an X when the menu is open. More info to come on the menu later.

D – I thought it could be good to call on more familiarity and use the now common green available dot which would call on the readers internet savy to quickly understand this is a sign of availability. The temptation was to include an animation on the dot to add some interactivity to the page and potentially a link to the contact section, but I thought this would lead to the user wanting to actually interact with the dot where there is no link and if there was a link, it could be premature to link straight to the contact page from the hero. The comprimise was to include a button (which is not included in the wireframe) just below this availability element with a link to current work/projects. The thought being that most readers would want to see evidence of work before trying to contact me as the site owner.

E – This is a small but important element which can be clicked (is also animated on hover on desktop) to take you down to the next section without having to scroll. It is common practice in web design to give a hint to what is further down a page from a sites homepage to show the reader there is more content. The downward bouncing animation of this arrow icon also tries to feed the thought of more content to the reader. 

![image of xd wireframe home section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/xd-home.jpg)

On this section, I added the blue to the hero box (later changed to a lighter blue for readability). The text was given the black color apart from the middle line as I wanted to emphasise this. This box is also where I first showcase the what will be common rounded corners aesthetic. 

The whole nav/title section also has a slight shadow which was not replicated in the final version.

The work button link is given a green color which is also another pattern to be followed which is button links being given a green color. The vertical line and arrow icon serve their respective purpose without the need for any added styling.

#### Mobile View About Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe about section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/wire-about.jpg)

F – The title of the next section (and following sections) is meant to be as simple as possible and do only what it should do, indicate the beginning of a new section. The text will be larger and bold to differenciate between normal text as is done in general web formatting.
 
G, H & I – I wanted the about me section to just make sense, be concise and easy to take information from. Therefore the parts of this section were broken up into expected smaller sections and structured in a way that is very logical. The picture is closely followed by a brief description of myself which is then followed by 2 lists floated on the left and right of the page with a vertical line between (not in wireframe) for differenciation. 

![image of xd wireframe about section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/xd-about.jpg)

For the about section, I decided to use a dark barckground on with white colored text to provide some freshness in the flow of the page. There is a good amount of contrast between the black background and the white text. The list styling was removed in the final version of the site and the text was aligned to the left and right respectively to allow for vidual separation.

#### Mobile View Skills Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe skills section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/wire-skills.jpg)

J – The skills section also follows the same thought process of being broken up into smaller sections and having a logical structure. I utilised relevant icons to reinforce the ideas of each mini section in the readers mind. 

Front End has a desktop which is the main viewport for many people and goes hand in hand with the thought of what the user sees. Back End has a server, another common thought when thinking about back-end development. The tools section has a wrench, again a common tool. 

Underneath each icon is the title of each mini section followed by a similar side by side list separated by a vertical line (not in wireframe) and each section (apart from the last one) is separated by a horizontal line.

![image of xd wireframe skills section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/xd-skills.jpg)

The skills section has color added to the icons to highlight the draw attention to them and highlight their relevance in each row. For each row section, the titles are in a larger font and bold which draws attention to them giving the ideal flow of information to the reader.

#### Mobile View Work Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe work section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/wire-work.jpg)

K – The work section employs a now familiar structural concept to the about me section. An eye-catching picture is followed by the name of the project, the tech/languages used and a brief description of the project. This is really giving the user the most relevant information in the most easy and accessible manner. There is also a visit button (not in wireframe) which takes the reader to the actual project site and will open in a new tab. The familiarity of the structure of the site would hopefully be within the reader by now which would make the whole experience of going through the site, much more cohesive and enjoyable.

![image of xd wireframe work section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/xd-work.jpg)

The work section was intended to have a similar structure to the about section with regards to the darker background. At this point I thought it might be good to use a lighter background from the about section but I later decided against this in favour of keeping consistent styling throughout the site. The darker background also was separated from the image in the final site due to the difficulty of having it halfway up the picture and making it work responsively.

#### Mobile View Contact Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe work section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/wire-work.jpg)

L, M & N – The contact section is broken up into two mini sections. I wanted to again give easy access to relevant information so the first section is simply a phone number and email address. I also thought it wise to include a contact form to give the reader the opportunity to easy send a message/email to me straight from the site. This is catering to different potential users and makes this section a little more accessible by not forcing the opening of another page/app to contact me.

![image of xd wireframe work section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/xd-work.jpg)

The contact section is pretty much as it is in the balsamiq wireframe but in the final site, I decided against having a blue container for the contact form and kept a white background. The thought behind this being that I wanted to keep the clean look of the website with color serving purpose and not just for the sake of it. A blue container for the contact form just was not necessary & does not marjorly increase the useability of the contact form for this screen size.

#### Mobile View Footer Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe footer section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/wire-footer.jpg)

O – The footer provides links to instagram where a user can go to have a more personal view of myself, my linkedin for a professional showcase and my github to check out more of my work. This section is outlined by a simple horizontal line with a bit of top margin after any former section.

![image of xd wireframe footer section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/xd-footer.jpg)

The footer was kept the same as it serves its purpose well enough as it was. 

#### Mobile View Nav Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe nav section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/wire-nav.jpg)

P – The open navigation menu is meant to be clean and work as expected. The page section links are in big font and well separated, the position of the X and the functionality of the menu (mmenu.js plug-in) means that the user can press the X or just click anyway outside the menu element to go close it and go back to the main site. 

Q – This would have been a good feature to have but there was an issue which will be talked about in the “features to add/bugs” section.

![image of xd wireframe nav section mobile view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-mob/xd-nav.jpg)

The off canvas nav was given a dark background and white text and spaced out section links for ease of use. The main page is also pushed to the side and dimmed out. The dimmed whole visible dimmed out section of the page works as a back button which closes the nav menu and returns you to the main site view.

#### Desktop View Home Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe home section deskop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/wire-desk-home.jpg)

A – The logo/title stays the same, just responively sizes. 

B – The menu is not needed to be off-canvas so there now a sticky horizontal nav bar which includes the logo/title. 

C – The hero section also responsively sizes to the larger viewport.

![image of xd wireframe home section desktop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/xd-desk-home.jpg)

This section retains the structural differences mentioned earlier for the desktop view and keeps the colors also mentioned earlier. In the final version the horizontal line between the work button and the arrow icon is also there. 

#### Desktop View About Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe about part 1 section deskop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/wire-desk-about.jpg)
![image of balsamiq wireframe about part 2 section deskop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/wire-desk-about2.jpg)

D & E – The structure of the about me section changes to be more horizontaly based to take advantage of the extra screen real estate. The picture is in the same row as the description keeping a structural familiarity. The trait list also responsively sizes but not to the extent seen in the wireframe compared to the final look.

![image of xd wireframe about part 1 section desktop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/xd-desk-about.jpg)
![image of xd wireframe about part 2 section desktop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/xd-desk-about2.jpg)

In this section I decided to reduce the overall size of it compared to this mock up. There is a large black colored container where a smaller image and the descriptive text sit parallel to each other. Just below that you have the trait list headings followed by the trait lists themselves. This part was made smaller so as to keep all of the about information on one “page” and make it as easily digestible as possible.

#### Desktop View Skills Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe skills section deskop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/wire-desk-skills.jpg)

F – The skills section has been also adjusted to have a horizontal structure with each mini srction laid out in a row separated by vertical lines. This showcases all important info in an easily taken in format, on one “page”. 

![image of xd wireframe skills section desktop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/xd-desk-skills.jpg)

This section also retains the structure of the balsamiq wireframe and the color of the mobile mock up shown earlier.

#### Desktop View Work Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe work section deskop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/wire-desk-work.jpg)

G – The work/projects section also receives the horizontal structural changes, with each mini section having a picture flanked by textual description and a horizontal line separating each row. They are also mirrored so in the row, the picture will be on right and in the second, the picture is on the left. This adds to the visual separation of each row and mini-section.

![image of xd wireframe work section desktop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/xd-desk-work.jpg)

The work section has some more obvious styling differences. There is a horizontal black container which starts underneath half of the picture and extends all the way to the right with white colored descriptive text still parallel to the image. This is then mirrored for the next project row with the image to the right and the black colored container stretching to the left of the viewport. 

I thought this would be a different take on the familiar black background & white text styling throughout the page. Doing this in the projects section also gives the readers interested in my work a bit more to look at compared to the rest of the site.

#### Desktop View Contact Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe contact section deskop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/wire-desk-contact.jpg)

H – The contact section is split into two to really emphasise the differing contact methods. To the left are the phone and email details and the right is a full contact form. The viewport width means this would be an expected layout and is an effective use of the page space.

![image of xd wireframe contact section desktop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/xd-desk-contact.jpg)

The contact form also keeps the same structure as the original wireframe but adds the blue and black background colors for the “lets talk” and “leave a message” sections respectively. With the text being white, readability is not an issue and the form input elements are also white providing a good amount of contrast.

#### Desktop View Footer Section

![image of balsamiq wireframe footer section deskop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/wire-desk-footer.jpg)

I – The footer is much the same with it only responsively sizing to take more width and the social media icons becoming larger.

![image of xd wireframe footer section desktop view]
(assets/images/readme/wire-desk/xd-desk-footer.jpg)

The footer again maintains its simplicity in structure and styling.

### Key Features

#### Off-Canvas Menu

I really wanted to use a nav menu that was not the default bootstrap one as I wanted something a bit more elegant and with the possibility to have a footer. After a lot of research, I came across this mmenu.js javascript plug-in that seemed to provide everything I was looking for. The difficulties in making the footer links work will be outlined in the “features left out” section. The options this plug in provided included sliding in from the right, tabbed menu’s, pre-pended headers & full screen menu’s for native app like navigation. Though very interesting, I decided to go with a simple & clean looking nav menu for this site.

#### Animated X in “open” state off canvas menu

The mmenu.js plug-in also offered the use of hamburger.js as an add-on to the main plug-in. This add-on allowed for the iinclusion of animated burger icons in the menu with a few different choices up for grabs. I decided to go with a unique twisting animation since the actual burger icon is so common these days, I thought it wise to have some differenciation where possible.

#### Sticky pull down nav bar

Another add-on related to mmenu.js is the sticky nav add-on which allows for the nav bar (in my case the logo/title and menu burger icon) to be hidden when scrolling down but made visible when scrolling up. This is a great feature for useability as hiding the nav when not in use really gives full immersion to the reader to all the content of the site and when they need to access the nav bar, it is only a swipe away.

#### Hover effects on buttons

The hover effects on the buttons give an important interactivity to the function of the button. It confirms or indicates that something will happen if you click this. The only frustration with this being the lack of hover effects for touch displays but research in this topic is something I will be doing soon.

#### Animation on arrow icon

The thought to have an animation on this icon was something that just made sense and is also something that I have seen a lot of great websites do. The downward pointing motion indicates the availability of more content and it is also clickable which takes the reader straight to the next section.

#### Icon usage in skills section

Using icons in this section made sense as mentioned earlier, they provide points of relation to the reader and increases the feeling of familiarity.

#### Responsively sizing elements

All the elements included in the site should be visible, accessible and interactable from any viewport. The responsiveness of the site was tested and tested again, all the elements will adjust responsively to different device viewports. This is important for many reasons but in the case for the website goals, it is so important that anyone, anywhere can access this site and access the content with ease and in the way I as the developer intended them to.

#### Desktop viewport specific styling, taking advantage of space.

When I was adjusting the structure of the site for larger device viewports I realised I needed to take advantage of the extra screen space in a cohesive, efficient and stylish way. This was an interesting challenge and one that I believe has resulted in a site that looks great in all device viewports. 

The downside being that I did not decide on the structural differences from a code point of view, it was purely from a design point of view with the aim of reaching the site goals. This meant that certain changes required a lot of code re-working and repeating which might not be the ideal workflow in the future. Armed with this knowledge though, that mistake will be learned from.

#### Hero Section

A hero section is a very common and almost classic way to welcome readers to a site. A Focused portion of the site with the most important information and often links to further content or information. My usage of a hero section allowed me to really serve the site requirements and goals in giving the reader easy to access information and keeping it simple. 

### Features left out

#### Nav footer with socials

There was a lot of difficulty just getting the mmenu.js plug-in to fuction properly. The footer section seemed to work but the icon links were not being directed to the proper href. After hours of research and troubleshooting, I gave up on this feature in order to secure the rest of the priorities when building the site. This is potentially something to come back to once I have more javascript knowledge.

#### Constantly animated green available dot

There was a thought to have this dot intermittently animate to add the the interctivity of the page. I did not go through with this idea as I thought it would lead readers to believe it could be a link, potentially adding to their cognitive overload. I had a second thought believing that maybe I could turn it into a link to the contact section, but I also did not implement this idea as I did not want to put off potential recruiters by offering contact information where the first priority would be looking at my work (hence why there is a “my work” link in the hero).

#### Further background styling

There were fears that the site was too simple looking and could do with some more background styling with shapes or lines of some sort. I decided against this more because of my own design or lack of design skills when it comes to using shapes and lines to compliment this type of site. This is something that could be implemented at a later stage though.

#### Half background container in work section mobile view

As mentioned earlier, I attempted to style the projects section so that the picture would at its halfway point (height-wise) have a black background which would overlap into the following textual description elements. I could not get this styling to work responsively as I wanted so I left it to focus on other features. It is another feature that can be implemented at a later date. 

#### Back to top button

There was a late thought to add a back to top button to the website, but this was proving difficult to implement. I then decided this could be a future feature to be added as I wanted to prioritise my time better and focus on getting the site working fully and efficiently.
